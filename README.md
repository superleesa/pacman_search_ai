## Pacman Heuristic and Adversarial Search

In this project, I design and implement an agent system for mainly two purposes:
1) Heuristic search algorithm, using IDA*, to collect a set of food optimally, in a limited amount of time. Please check this [link](https://github.com/superleesa/pacman_search_ai/blob/assignment1/solvers/q1c_solver.py).
2) Adversarial search algorithm, using Alpha-Beta search, to find the optimal action against ghosts. Please check this [link](https://github.com/superleesa/pacman_search_ai/blob/assignment1/agents/q2aAgent.py).

Note that code related to game states and graphics originally came from the UC Berkley AI Project team.
